# ClaudeMeter

![ClaudeMeter](docs/heading.png)

Keep track of your Claude.ai plan usage at a glance.

## Features

- **Real-time usage monitoring** - Track your 5-hour session, 7-day weekly, and model-specific usage limits
- **Any model, no update needed** - Model-specific limits (Fable, Opus, Sonnet, ...) are read from whatever the API reports, so a newly launched model is listed in Settings without an app update; switch on the ones you want shown in the popover
- **Menu bar integration** - Clean, colour-coded usage indicator that lives in your macOS menu bar
- **Multiple icon styles** - Choose from 6 icon styles: Battery, Circular, Minimal, Segments, Dual Bar, or Gauge
- **Pacing indicator** - Flame icon warns when you're using Claude faster than sustainable pace
- **Smart notifications** - Configurable alerts at warning and critical thresholds (defaults: 75% and 90%)
- **Auto-refresh** - Automatic usage updates every 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes

## Screenshots

### Menu Bar

The menu bar icon changes colour based on your usage levels:

When a model has its own weekly cap, an additional card shows that model's usage:

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew install eddmann/tap/claudemeter
```

### Manual Download

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/eddmann/ClaudeMeter/releases)
2. Unzip and move `ClaudeMeter.app` to Applications
3. Double-click to open

The app is signed and notarized by Apple, so it will open without any security warnings.

## Usage

### First Launch

1. ClaudeMeter appears in your menu bar as a gauge icon
2. The setup wizard will guide you through initial configuration
3. Import from a browser signed in to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), or paste your session manually
4. The app validates your session and begins monitoring usage

### Claude Session Setup

ClaudeMeter can import your existing Claude session from local browser cookies. Sign in to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in a supported browser, then choose **Import from Browser** in the setup wizard or Settings.

Chrome, Arc, Brave, Edge, and other Chromium browsers may ask for browser Safe Storage Keychain access so ClaudeMeter can decrypt cookies. Safari cookies are protected by macOS and may require Full Disk Access.

If browser import is unavailable, paste your session manually. ClaudeMeter accepts either a raw `sk-ant-...` session key or a Cookie header containing `sessionKey=...`.

#### Manual Session Setup

Your Claude session key is stored in your browser cookies.

**Chrome/Edge:**

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to Application > Cookies > `https://claude.ai`
4. Find the `sessionKey` cookie (starts with `sk-ant-`)
5. Copy the value

**Safari:**

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Go to Develop > Show Web Inspector (enable Develop menu in Safari preferences if needed)
3. Go to Storage > Cookies > `https://claude.ai`
4. Find the `sessionKey` cookie (starts with `sk-ant-`)
5. Copy the value

**Firefox:**

1. Open [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to Storage > Cookies > `https://claude.ai`
4. Find the `sessionKey` cookie (starts with `sk-ant-`)
5. Copy the value

### Daily Use

- Monitor your usage at a glance with the colour-coded menu bar icon
- Click the icon to access detailed statistics and adjust settings
- Receive automatic notifications when reaching warning or critical thresholds

### Integration with External Tools

ClaudeMeter exports usage data to `~/.claudemeter/usage.json` for use with external tools like Claude Code statusline scripts, shell prompts, or custom dashboards.

**JSON format:**

```json
{
  "last_updated": "2025-12-24T07:30:00Z",
  "session_usage": {
    "reset_at": "2025-12-24T12:00:00Z",
    "utilization": 29
  },
  "weekly_usage": {
    "reset_at": "2025-12-30T00:00:00Z",
    "utilization": 45
  },
  "scoped_usage": [
    {
      "name": "Fable",
      "is_active": true,
      "limit": {
        "reset_at": "2025-12-30T00:00:00Z",
        "utilization": 23
      }
    }
  ],
  "sonnet_usage": {
    "reset_at": "2025-12-30T00:00:00Z",
    "utilization": 15
  }
}
```

`scoped_usage` lists every model-specific limit the API reports, named as the API names it.
`sonnet_usage` is kept as a deprecated alias so existing statusline scripts keep working; it is
present only when a Sonnet limit exists. Prefer `scoped_usage` for new scripts.

**Example: Claude Code statusline**

Create `~/.claude/statusline.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
usage=$(jq -r '.session_usage.utilization' ~/.claudemeter/usage.json 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$usage" ] || [ "$usage" = "null" ]; then
  echo "Usage: ~"
elif [ "$usage" -lt 50 ]; then
  echo -e "\033[32mUsage: ${usage}%\033[0m"
elif [ "$usage" -lt 80 ]; then
  echo -e "\033[33mUsage: ${usage}%\033[0m"
else
  echo -e "\033[31mUsage: ${usage}%\033[0m"
fi
```

Then configure Claude Code's `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "bash ~/.claude/statusline.sh"
  }
}
```
